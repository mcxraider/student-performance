# student-performance
ML project to predict students performance on tests 

Goal here is to predict students performance on tests (Integer)

Hope to achieve:
- Alot of quality EDA
- Experiment with at least 2 ANNs purely using pytorch 
- Bayesian optimisation for fine tuning of parameters
- MSE must be really good
- possibly explore the use of GANs to generate new synthetic data
-
