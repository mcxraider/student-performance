# student-performance
ML project to predict students performance on tests 

Goal here is to predict students performance on tests (Integer)

Machine Learning models experimented with:
- Regression Trees
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Bossting Regressor
- Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost)
- LightGMB
- Multiple Linear Regression
with Bayesian optimisation for Hyperparameter tuning


Deep Learning models experimented with:
- ANN 1
- ANN 2
with Bayesian optimisation for Hyperparameter tuning

Hope to achieve:
- Alot of quality EDA
- Experiment with at least 2 ANNs purely using pytorch 
- Bayesian optimisation for fine tuning of parameters
- MSE must be really good
- possibly explore the use of GANs to generate new synthetic data
